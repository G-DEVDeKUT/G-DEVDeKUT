Welcome to GDEV DEKUT üõ∞Ô∏è
Welcome to the official GitHub account of G-DEVDeKUT, a club dedicated to Geospatial Development, Remote Sensing, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for remote sensing applications. This account serves as a hub for our projects, collaborations, and resources related to geospatial technologies and their integration with cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.

About Us üåç
G-DEVDeKUT is a student-led club at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) focused on exploring and advancing the field of geospatial development and remote sensing. We aim to:

Promote the use of geospatial technologies for solving real-world problems.

Integrate Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into remote sensing workflows.

Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among students, researchers, and professionals in the geospatial community.

Develop innovative tools and applications for environmental monitoring, urban planning, disaster management, and more.

What We Do üöÄ
Geospatial Development: Building tools and applications for spatial data analysis, mapping, and visualization.

Remote Sensing: Processing and analyzing satellite imagery and other remote sensing data.

Machine Learning & AI: Developing models for image classification, object detection, and predictive analytics in remote sensing.

Open Source Contributions: Sharing code, tutorials, and resources to empower the geospatial community.

Projects üìÇ
Here are some of the projects we‚Äôre working on or planning to explore:

Satellite Image Classification: Using ML/AI to classify land cover types from satellite imagery.

Geospatial Data Visualization: Creating interactive maps and dashboards for spatial data.

Environmental Monitoring: Developing tools for tracking deforestation, urbanization, and climate change impacts.

Disaster Management: Building systems for real-time disaster monitoring and response using remote sensing data.

Stay tuned for updates and contributions to these projects!
