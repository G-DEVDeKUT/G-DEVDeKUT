# Welcome to GDEV DEKUT üõ∞Ô∏è

Welcome to the official GitHub account of **G-DEVDeKUT**, a club dedicated to **Geospatial Development, Remote Sensing, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** for remote sensing applications. This account serves as a hub for our projects, collaborations, and resources related to geospatial technologies and their integration with cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.

## About Us üåç

**G-DEVDeKUT** is a student-led club at [Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT)](https://www.dkut.ac.ke/) focused on exploring and advancing the field of geospatial development and remote sensing. We aim to:

- Promote the use of geospatial technologies for solving real-world problems.
- Integrate Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into remote sensing workflows.
- Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among students, researchers, and professionals in the geospatial community.
- Develop innovative tools and applications for environmental monitoring, urban planning, disaster management, and more.

## What We Do üöÄ

- **Geospatial Development**: Building tools and applications for spatial data analysis, mapping, and visualization.
- **Remote Sensing**: Processing and analyzing satellite imagery and other remote sensing data.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Developing models for image classification, object detection, and predictive analytics in remote sensing.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Sharing code, tutorials, and resources to empower the geospatial community.

## Projects üìÇ

Here are some of the projects we‚Äôre working on or planning to explore:

1. **Satellite Image Classification**: Using ML/AI to classify land cover types from satellite imagery.
2. **Geospatial Data Visualization**: Creating interactive maps and dashboards for spatial data.
3. **Environmental Monitoring**: Developing tools for tracking deforestation, urbanization, and climate change impacts.
4. **Disaster Management**: Building systems for real-time disaster monitoring and response using remote sensing data.

Stay tuned for updates and contributions to these projects!
